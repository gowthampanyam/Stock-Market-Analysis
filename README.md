# Stock Market Time Series Prediction with LSTM - Apple Stock Prices

## Overview

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Apple stock prices based on historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on the remaining data to assess its predictive performance.

## Project Structure

- `apple_share_price.csv`: Dataset containing OHLC values for Apple stock prices.
- `stockMarketAnalysis.py`: Main code for the project.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- keras (TensorFlow backend)
